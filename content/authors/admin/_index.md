Welcome! I am a political scientist and public policy scholar studying political behavior and American political institutions. My dissertation applies causal inference and computational methods to understand how contact with criminal-legal institutions affects political behavior.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in government at Cornell University. My research has been published in the British Journal of Criminology, the Journal of Criminal Justice, Punishment & Society, and is under review at other outlets. I am a Graduate Research Fellow with the National Science Foundation and was previously a Mitofsky and Kohut fellow at the Roper Center for Public Opinion. My work has also been generously funded by a variety of other sources including the American Political Science Association’s Centennial Grant, the PRICE institute (at Cornell), and the Population Center (at Cornell).
